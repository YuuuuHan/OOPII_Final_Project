# OOPII_Final_Project
Using **Java language** to build GUI interface, and determine the movement strategy of the object through **different command** and **various algorithms**, including **DFS, BFS and UCS**, and the object can not collide with any obstacles in the process of movement.
## Illustrate
- **Map_id**:  Depending on the map_id, the displayed map style will be different.
- **JfScaler**: Use to set the map zoom size.
- **Milliseconds**: Use to set the speed of object movement.
- **Algorithm**:
  - If it is a **DFS algorithm**, the value is set to **0**.
  - If it is a **BFS algorithm**, the value is set to **1**.
## Run the project
Use **X2go** and run the project according to the following instructions:
```
1. javac A1073317_checkpoint7_DemoGame.java
2. java A1073317_checkpoint7_DemoGame map_id jfScaler milliseconds algorithm 
   (e.g. java A1073317_checkpoint7_DemoGame 0 4 20 1)
```
